# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis
Using Jupyter Notebook and Python to conduct an in-depth school data analysis for reading and math assessment scores to help identify patterns and trends in students'achievements based on school size, budget, and type. Before sharing the final results to the school board members, math and Reading scores for Thomas High School's 9th graders must be replacesd with NaNs (Not a Number) and all deliverables must be recalculated.

### List of requested deliverables:
- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
- Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
- The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
- School performance based on the budget per student
- School performance based on the school size 
- School performance based on the type of school

### Tools:
- GitBash
- Anaconda
- Jupyter-Notebook
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Virtual Studio Code

Fig.3 - Thomas High School Summary

As shown in the comparison below, the school saw significant drops in math and reading passing percentage, and overall passing percentage. Average scores for math and reading remained almost the same.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade

- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type



## Summary: 
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
